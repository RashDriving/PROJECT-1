
MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM 
This is a basic movie recommendation system. It is not very refined and uses rubrics like 'title', 'director', 'tagline', 'overview', etc, to find the closest match of the films that the user likes. I have also used Streamlit here, so you can view it on a local host in your default browser. 
You can check the requirements.txt file below to learn about the modules used in this system. 
you can run this in the terminal by typing streamlit run MOVIES.py
The recommender system would start working on your local host server, in your default browser. 
You can now type a movie you like, and get recommendations.
